# prok_gene_blocks

Hi, there!üëã  

This repository contains the code used to identify blocks of core genes for the publication "Prevalence and Dynamics of Genome Rearrangements in Bacteria
and Archaea". Before identifying gene blocks, you first have to find the core genome of your microbial species. To do so, you need to install and run *Corecruncher*. The program will take yout fasta files containing predicted protein amino acid sequences (e.g., output files of Prodigal). 

‚û°Ô∏è *Corecruncher* information:
